Playing around with making an LED strip respond to music and sound.

One program uses an fft to make the strip change colors in response to frequency - lower sounds give redder light, but there is some latency there.

The more fun program responds only to loadness by varying the intensity of a color. Big changes (ideally the beat) cause it to change into anyother random color.
